PROJECT TITLE: Card Game
VERSION: 2.0
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
The program will ask you to input an integer value of n, where 1<n<8.
This is the number of players the game will have.
If the value you given is not valid it will ask you to input a new value.
This process is repeated until a valid integer is given.
If the input you give is valid it will ask you to give the location of a text file, which must
contain integers on seperate lines to create cards. If the file is deemed valid, the game will then start.
If the file is not valid, you will be told why and asked to input a new file location.
This is process is repeated until a valid file is given.
